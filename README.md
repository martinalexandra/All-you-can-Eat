#Proyect zayas 2014 (All you can Eat)

Project developed by: Alexandra Martín, Maurice Dominguez and Pablo Andrés-Gayón during the course of 2DAW of María de Zayas.

##Reason of the project:

We decided to do an application to help people to find their most fauvorite and visited restaurants by allowing them to save their visits, orders and saving the position of that restaurant in a custom and editable map. 

##Description:

The user interface will have a list of our supported restaurants where you can select and save them into the map.
It will provide the user the posibility of change his preferences, edit his customed map and share his restaurants with any other user.

At the end you will have an account with your personal information so you dont have to give your name and address over and over.

##Content:

This application will have this features being able to be changed in a future.
